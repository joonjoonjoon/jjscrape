"O Christmas Tree"

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
With faithful leaves unchanging.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
With faithful leaves unchanging,
Not only green in summer's heat,
But also winter's snow and sleet;
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
With faithful leaves unchanging.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Of all the trees most lovely.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Of all the trees most lovely;
Each year you bring to me delightGleaming in the Christmas night.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Of all the trees most lovely.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Your leaves will teach me also,
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Your leaves will teach me also
That hope and love and faithfulness
Are precious things I can possess.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,Your leaves will teach me also.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,How lovely are your branches.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,How lovely are your branches.
In summer sun or winter snowA coat of green you always show.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,How lovely are your branches.
